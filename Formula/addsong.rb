# Homebrew formula for addsong.
#
# This file is ready to drop into a personal "tap" repository so users can run:
#
#     brew install ado11231/tap/addsong
#
# A tap is just a GitHub repo named `homebrew-tap` with a `Formula/` directory;
# one tap can hold the formulae for all of your tools. See RELEASE.md for the
# exact steps to publish (tag the release, fill in the sha256, create the tap).
#
# Before publishing, replace YOURNAME with your GitHub username and set the
# sha256 to the checksum of the release tarball (RELEASE.md shows how).
